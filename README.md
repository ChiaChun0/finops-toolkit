> ℹ️ _This project is in the early concept phase. If interested, please contact micflan@microsoft.com._

A Microsoft Cloud FinOps hub is a **virtual command center** for leaders throughout the organization to report on, monitor, and optimize cost based on their organizational needs. FinOps hubs focus on 3 core design principles:

- **Be the standard**<br>_<sup>Strive to be the principal embodiment of the FinOps Framework.</sup>_
- **Built for scale**<br>_<sup>Designed to support the largest accounts and organizations.</sup>_
- **Open and extensible**<br>_<sup>Embrace the ecosystem and prioritize enabling the platform.</sup>_

Our goal is to deliver a reliable, trustworthy platform for cost analytics, insights, and optimization that enables organizations to achieve more with less through community, partner, and homegrown solutions.
